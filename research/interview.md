- “would like commercial longevity”. want it to succeed as a company
- “it we don’t drive development and understanding”
- “we can’t keep draining from a pool and expect it to remain full”
- “in order to perpetuate [the values of the business] we have to invest in those values”
- “giving people the time to engage in community”
- “if we give someone 4 hours, they’ll probably contribute their own 4 hours”

## Should businesses be afraid of recruitment?

- “people look at it as a hierarchical arrangement but its more of a partnership”
- “i get back what i give”
- “they’re in a place that values and supports them”
- “much more likely to force people out the door if you restrict what they want to do”
- “you have to trust people”
- “if someone comes to a meetup and poaches someone, they were going to leave anyway”
